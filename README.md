# Sum-and-Product-Puzzle
The solution of the sum and product puzzle

Problem Statement:
X and Y are two whole numbers greater than 1, and Y > X. Their sum is not greater than 100. S and P are two mathematicians (and consequently perfect logicians); S knows the sum X + Y and P knows the product X Ã— Y. Both S and P know all the information in this paragraph.

In the following conversation, both participants are always telling the truth:

S says "P does not know X and Y."

P says "Now I know X and Y."

S says "Now I also know X and Y."

What are X and Y?
